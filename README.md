### Hello, world! 👋
I joined the tech industry in 2021, and since then I have been continuously improving my programming skills in Python, Java, PostgreSQL, SQL, MongoDB, Pandas, JUnit, AWS Cloud Services, Docker, Spring, and FastAPI.

My career goal is to help develop solutions that make the world a better place for everyone. I have a degree in Journalism and worked as a reporter for a decade before transitioning into tech. In addition to my work as a developer, I also take on freelance projects as a data reporter, collecting and analyzing data from public sources.

I believe in the power of information as a driver of real social transformation, and I am always eager to help promote positive change through technology around the world.
