### About me
My first graduation was Journalism and I had worked as a reporter, covering economics and finance, for over 10 years. That took me to (almost) graduate in economics as well (I was an undergraduate student in Economics for 3 years at Unifesp). 
But something was missing. I've always believed in the power of information as a motor for real transformation in society and I felt I needed to dig deeper into that. That's how I got in touch with the Data Science world and decided to go for a turning point in my career. 
I've started to study Data Science topics, like Python, Databases and Statistics (I had a little bit of stats in Economics, by the way). Two years ago I had my first opportunity to make a drastic move towards my goal. I was offered a job in the technology industry, as a QA, automating tests. Even though that job was not what I had planned for my career change, I figured it would help me improve programming skills, so I took that chance.
Now it's time to gather all that baggage and move on. I want to be part of more challenging software development projects and, one day, to work on projects of machine learning and IA development.
