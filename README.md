### About me
Former journalist, I started a new career in the Tech Industry two years ago, when I took my first job as a test automation developer. I had joined projects of companies such as Santander Bank, Ab-Inbev and Redecard, working within agile methodologies, and improved programming skills in stacks such as Python, Java, Selenium WebDriver, Rest-Assured, Node.js, Postgres, MongoDB, AWS Cloud, Docker. I am also familiar with some back-end frameworks,like FastAPI, Express and Spring, and I've been dedicating to a developer career.
I've always believed in the power of information as a motor for real transformation in society. As a former journalist, I discovered the Data Science world and that took me back to Software Development - I had taken a programming technician course in 2000, but at that time I did not really connect to that universe. Ironically, over 20 years later I would finally understand how to use programming skills to promote social change.
