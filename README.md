### About me
Former journalist, I started a new career in the Tech Industry two years ago, when I took my first job as a test automation developer. I had joined projects of companies such as Santander Bank, Ab-Inbev and Redecard, working within agile methodologies, and improved programming skills in stacks such as Python, Java, Selenium WebDriver, Rest-Assured, Postgres, SQL, MongoDB, AWS Cloud Services. I also know FastAPI and Flask Frameworks, and I've been dedicating to a back-end development.
I am familiar with a little bit of Java, Node.js and Golang as well, but my "main" language is Python, still. I know some CSS and HTML too.
I've always believed in the power of information as a motor for real transformation in society. As a former journalist, I discovered the Data Science world and that took me back to Software Development - I had taken a programming technician course in 2000, but at that time I did not really connect to that universe. Ironically, over 20 years later I finally understood how to use programming knowledge to promote social change. I am now looking for an opportunity to persue a developer career.
